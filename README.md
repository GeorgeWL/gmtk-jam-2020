Jam Theme: **Out of Control**

## Game Idea

As the Jam Theme is "Out of Control", I thought an interesting idea would be a platformer in which the initial state is:

* **W** - Up
* **A** - Left
* **D** - Right

But that whenever a key is released, the key which does that action is randomly replaced with another letter or number key (that's not already set).

To make it not completly infuriating, the current keys for each action will be shown on screen at all times, and will have a visual signifier that have changed (likely a shuffle animation).

As a latter addition to the mechanic, will have it that enemy collision (player character has no weapons and either limited hearts or a life meter) will change a random control which is not currently in use.
